# Frontend-with-React
- This repository contains a collection of mini projects built with React. Each project demonstrates core React concepts such as functional components, hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.), context API for state management, and React Router for navigation. 
- These mini-projects cover a variety of use cases, such as form handling, API integration with Axios, state management, and dynamic UI rendering. 
- The goal is to provide hands-on examples that illustrate how to build scalable, component-based applications using React. Each project follows modern ES6+ and best coding practices to promote clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

# Mini Project One
- These projects put my react basic skills on test. I had been learining props,components and styling with tailwindCSS and Typescript.
